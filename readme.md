# Low Poly Models

This is a collection of low poly models for made for games. They don't come with a texture but are otherwise game ready.

## Early Release Notice

This collection is still in its infancy, which means the models are not considered stable. Individual models may still change drastically.

## Issues

There are errors with smoothing that have not been addressed. Some of the models need to be re-exported to fix this.

The models are intended to be used with a plain color as a texture and have not been properly uv-mapped for applying an actual texture.
